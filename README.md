🚢 Titanic EDA Project
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers and survival patterns.

📌 Project Overview
Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset

Renamed columns for better clarity

Handled missing values

Replaced numerical categories with meaningful labels

Dropped unnecessary columns

Visualized the data using:

Pie Chart (Survival Distribution)

Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)

Histograms (Age, Fare distributions)

Boxplots (Fare vs Survival)

Scatterplots (Age vs Fare)

📊 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

💡 Insights
Higher-class passengers had higher survival rates

Females and children were more likely to survive

Most passengers embarked from port 'S'

Age and Fare showed interesting distributions and patterns

📁 Dataset
This project uses the Titanic dataset (test.csv format) with 418 entries.

✅ Future Improvements
Apply Machine Learning models for survival prediction

Optimize visualizations further

Handle missing values more effectively
